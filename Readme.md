Solar Berries
=============
(Working Title)

This is an arbitrary game concept we intend to develop in Ruby.

Basic Game
----------

The players cooperate to fly a ship and collect blueberries from planets across
solar system.

Control will be similar to RTS top-down. Players will control themselves.

Players will walk around the interior of the ship, taking over consoles to
control various aspects of ship functionality. Players will leave the ship to
scour the planets for the precious blueberries.

Hopefully, there will be enemies who shoot at players and are generally
threatening.
